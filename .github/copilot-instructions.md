# BuggyBoard: Use Specs as Context

When working on the **BuggyBoard** web app (bug tracker SUT for the Playwright course):

1. **Read the constitution** (`specs/constitution.md`) and the specs under `specs/` before implementing. Use at least:
   - `specs/product/vision.md` – what we're building
   - `specs/design/theme.md` – color theme and UI/UX design rules
   - `specs/engineering/tech-stack.md` – stack and constraints
   - `specs/engineering/coding-standards.md` – style and architecture
   - `specs/engineering/development-process.md` – spec-first, feature-by-feature, pause for review
2. **For a feature**, use the corresponding spec in `specs/features/` (e.g. `specs/features/01-login.md`).
3. **Update** `specs/PROGRESS.md` when a feature or step is completed.
4. **Pause for review** after each feature; do not start the next feature until the user directs.
5. **Ask the user** when a decision is unclear instead of assuming.
6. **Write atomic tests rather than grand tours**. Each test should focus on a single feature or behavior, and not try to cover multiple features at once.
   - Tests should follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, and be clear and concise.
   -Each test should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
